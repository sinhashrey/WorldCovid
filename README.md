# World COVID exploration & visualisation
* The SQL queries file consists the queries regarding data exploration.
* The Tableau queries file contains SQL queries that I used to import data into Tableau and then further visualise it. The visualisation is available in this [Tableau Worksheet](https://public.tableau.com/shared/SF56XMXM9?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
