# World COVID exploration & visualisation
* Data Exploration file consists of the SQL queries to find insights in the data.
* The Tableau queries file contains SQL queries that I used to import data into Tableau and then further visualise it. The visualisation is available in this [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/WorldwideCOVID_16516369248040/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
